# Screenshots and Photos

This folder holds UI screenshots/photos for the README.

## SD File List UI (File-Number Mode)

- Target file path in README: `docs/sd-file-list-ui.png`
- Temporary placeholder committed: `docs/sd-file-list-ui.svg`

### How to Capture
1. Flash the latest firmware and power the device.
2. At boot, enter code `5550` to open the SD file-number screen.
3. Make sure a microSD card with `NNNN.txt` files (e.g., `0001.txt`) is inserted.
4. Use your phone to take a clear photo of the display.
5. Crop to the screen, keep the two-column list visible.
6. Save as `sd-file-list-ui.png` in the `docs/` folder.
7. Optionally keep the SVG placeholder around for reference.

### Image Guidelines
- Format: PNG
- Suggested width: 640–1280 px (GitHub will scale down)
- Keep glare/reflections minimal
- Ensure text is readable (auto-focus, no motion blur)

Once the PNG is added, the README will display it automatically.
